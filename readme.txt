== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= My theme already displays the content of the description field? =

If you add the text "PS: " (note the blank) somewhere in the description field,
only the text before will be available to your theme,
while the rest will be shown by Post Scriptum at the end of posts.

= Another question? =
